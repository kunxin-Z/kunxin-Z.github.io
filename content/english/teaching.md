## Teaching Philosophy

My goal as a teacher is to create an engaging, hands-on learning environment that fosters students' enthusiasm for exploring relevant topics while equipping them with the tools they need to approach real-life problems. My teaching philosophy is rooted in a deep passion for the content I teach and a commitment to spreading that enthusiasm with students I teach. I believe that when students sense their instructor's genuine excitement for a subject, they are more likely to engage deeply with the material themselves. I strive to create an interactive learning environment that nurtures this curiosity and provides methods for students to overcome potential obstacles.
